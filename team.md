**Douglas Blackiston** is a Senior Scientist in the Allen Discovery Center at Tufts University where his [research program](https://douglas-blackiston.weebly.com/) has the overarching goal of understanding developmental plasticity --- the response of cell populations in vivo to alterations in patterning, local environment, and signaling from neighboring tissues.  His work encompasses many diverse questions and models, from the ability of memory to survive metamorphosis in moths and butterflies, to the capacity of transplanted eyes to restore vision in blind vertebrates.

**Emma Lederer** is a Research Assistant in the Allen Discovery Center at Tufts University. She uses [her background](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emma-lederer-809a7b143/) in fluid mechanics and developmental biology to investigate interactions between organisms and their environment both at an individual and community level.

**Sam Kriegman** is a Postdoctoral Associate at the University of Vermont. 
His research explores evolutionary robotics: the automatic creation of novel robots and biological machines that are capable of safely performing useful work.
Sam co-organizes the [Virtual Creatures Competition](https://virtualcreatures.github.io/), 
has co-authored numerous peer-reviewed [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DCIwaLwAAAAJ), 
and co-manages the open-source soft robot kit [voxcraft](https://voxcraft.github.io/).

**Simon Garnier** is is an Associate Professor of Biology at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. He is the head of the Swarm Lab, an interdisciplinary research lab that studies the mechanisms underlying Collective Behaviors and Swarm Intelligence in natural and artificial systems. His research aims to reveal the detailed functioning of collective intelligence in systems as diverse as ant colonies, human crowds or robotic swarms. Dr. Garnier's work is or has been supported by multiple grants from DARPA, NSF, and the James S. McDonnell Foundation. His twitter handle is @sjmgarnier.

**Josh Bongard** is the Veinott Professor of Computer Science at the University of Vermont and the director of the [Morphology, Evolution & Cognition Laboratory](https://www.meclab.org/). His work involves computational approaches to the automated design and manufacture of soft-, evolved-, and crowdsourced robots, as well as living systems. A PECASE, TR35, and Microsoft New Faculty Fellow award recipient, he has received funding from NSF, NASA, DARPA, the U.S. Army Research Office and the Sloan Foundation. He is the author of the book How The Body Shapes the Way We Think. He runs an evolutionary robotics MOOC through [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/ludobots/wiki/index#welcome) and a robotics outreach program, Twitch Plays Robotics.

**Michael Levin** is the Vannevar Bush Professor of Biology at Tufts University, and the director of the [Allen Discovery Center at Tufts](https://allencenter.tufts.edu/). His work uses developmental biophysics, cognitive science, and computational modeling approaches to understand tissue plasticity, especially focused on bioelectrical information processing in non-neural cell networks. Working at the intersection of regenerative biology and basal cognition, his group seeks to develop new applications in birth defects, regeneration, cancer, and synthetic morphology by learning how cell collectives make morphological decisions and cracking that code to motivate them toward desired anatomical outcomes.
