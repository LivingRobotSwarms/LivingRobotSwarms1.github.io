A group of living robots 24 hours after construction.  They naturally form into spheres in saline solutions, and their surface becomes more irregular as they develop.

Our previous living robots moved by ‘walking’, which was driven by muscle contractions. Our new design allows individuals to ‘swim’ by the combined beating of many hairlike structures on the bot surface.  These can be observed with fluorescent markers, which are seen in the above image as tufts of orange spots.
